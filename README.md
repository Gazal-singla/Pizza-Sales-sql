# Pizza Sales SQL Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project is my first hands-on SQL case study based on a Pizza Sales dataset.  
I wrote SQL queries to answer 13 business-related questions and shared the results visually through a presentation.
This project helped me practice **joins, aggregations, sorting, filtering, and window functions** â€” all while thinking from a business point of view.

## Key SQL Concepts Used

- `INNER JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
- Aggregation functions: `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`
- Window functions: `RANK()`, `SUM() OVER (PARTITION BY...)`
- Filtering with `WHERE`, `HAVING`, `LIMIT`
